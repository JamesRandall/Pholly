    "## What is Pholly\n",
    "\n",
    "Pholly provides a more natural way to use Polly from within F# and uses a number of F# language features to provide an expressive DSL type approach to using common resilience patterns. Currently the three Polly reactive resilience patterns are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Pattern|Purpose|\n",
    "|-------|-------|\n",
    "|Retry|Many faults are transient and may self-correct after a short delay and the retry pattern will attempt to retry the operation until it succeeds or a failure condition is met|\n",
    "|Circuit Breaker|When a system is seriously struggling, failing fast is better than making users/callers wait. The circuit breaker can protect a faulting system from overloading and help it recover.|\n",
    "|Fallback|Things can and do fail and it can be useful to provide a fallback|\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pholly Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object Oriented code its common to indicate failures through the use of exceptions and when used with C# Polly is commonly used in this way. For example you might retry an operation against a SQL database if a SqlException is received with a throttle status code. Although exceptions are used in F# its common to use the Result<> type to handle errors - exceptions can be ignored but the use of the Result discriminated union means that code has to cater for error scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retry Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below shows a simple retry policy that will roll a dice and continue to retry until a 5 or higher is rolled.\n",
