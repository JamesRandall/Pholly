# Pholly

A F# friendly wrapper for Polly policies that aims to be expressive and clear to read and reason about.

Documentation can be found in the [Dotnet Interactive Notebook](https://github.com/JamesRandall/Pholly/blob/main/notebooks/PhollyIntroduction.ipynb).

Please do leave any feedback you might have as a GitHub Issue, I know some of the builder code needs tidying but I'm particularly interested in how expressive you find the interface - I'm really aiming for something that is very clear and readable.

## Thanks

Many thanks to the creators of [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) itself - I've used it in many production systems and I've used some of their descriptions of the patterns here.

And thanks to [Scott Wlaschin](https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin) for the name. If I have a kryptonite its naming things.
